/*

JavaScript Definition breakdown

*/

// High Level Language
// Do not need to manage resources as there are abstractions
// These are not as optimized as low level

// Garbage Collection
// CLeans up memory automatically

// Interpreted or just in time compiled
// Conversion happens in the javascript engine

// Multi-paradigm
// Paradigm - approach/mindset of structuring code
// Procedural, Object Oriented, or Functional

// Prototype-based object-oriented
// Everything is an object, arryas are created from array template(prototype) which has all the blueprint methods

// First-class functions
// FUnctions are treated as varriables, can pass in functions and return them from functions

// Dynamically typed language
// No data type definitions, data types on variables can be changed on the fly
// Look into typescript for javascript with types

// Single-threaded
// Non-blocking event loop

// Concurrency model
// how javascirpt handles multiple tasks happening at the same time
// Since javascript runs ina  single thread it can only do one thing at a time
// By using an event loop and runnign long running tasks in the background and pushes them back on the main thread when they are finished
